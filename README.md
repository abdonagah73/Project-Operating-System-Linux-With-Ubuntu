🚀 From Theory to Real Linux

📅 24/12/2025

Today, we successfully delivered our Linux Process Management project as part of the Operating Systems course, and it truly feels like a meaningful milestone for our team.

This project was developed by:

Abdelrahman Mohamed Nagah

Mohamed Ashraf Mohamed Attia

Omar Mohamed Morsi Imam

Mazen Ahmed Kamel Ahmed

Saif Alden Ahmed Hesen


🎓 Course: Operating Systems
👩‍🏫 Instructor: Dr. Samar
🏫 Faculty: Engineering
🧠 Major: Intelligent Systems
🏛️ University: Helwan National University

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with essential operating system concepts, including:

Process creation and management using fork()

Multithreading with POSIX Threads (pthreads)

CPU scheduling and priority control

Signal handling (SIGTERM vs SIGKILL)

Zombie and orphan processes

Monitoring processes using Linux tools and scripts

Building a Java GUI to visualize and manage processes


This project wasn’t just about coding, but about understanding how operating systems work under the hood and turning theory into real-world practice.

Proud of the teamwork and effort behind this delivery.
This is a great starting point and a positive step forward 🚀
